Reference page:
https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/apt-get.8.html


Note: apt-get and apt are different things

apt-get update
- resynchronize the package index

apt-get -y install nano
- y = automatic yes to prompts
- install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading
- package is a package name, not a fully qualified filename

nano /usr/src/app/index.js
- opens index.js with nano

note: next command will cause installation error if following course material. Node 16 is old.
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash
- curl  is a tool to transfer data from or to a server
- s = Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  messages
- L or location = If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this  option will  make  curl  redo  the  request  on  the  new place.
- | = pipe, send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing; used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command.
- Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file

apt install -y nodejs
- apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8).
- installs the previously downloaded nodejs package.
- y = yes to prompts

node /usr/src/app/index.js
- runs index.js with node

mkdir /usr/src/app
- make directory
