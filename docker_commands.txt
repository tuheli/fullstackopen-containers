List of used docker commands


Note: better way to build images and run containers is achieved with dockerfiles


Command line reference:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/


docker -v
- shows docker version

aliases:
docker run
docker container run

docker container run hello-world
- create and run a new container from an image
- if the specified image is not found locally, docker will try to download one from docker hub

docker container run -it ubuntu bash
- options -i -t are combined into -it
- i = interactive, t = allocate a pseudo-TTY (pseudo terminal)

docker container run --help
- shows help page for docker run

docker container run --rm ubuntu ls
- rm = automatically remove the container when it exits
- ls = terminal command to list directory contents

docker container ls -a
- lists containers
- a = show all container (default shows just running)
- alias = docker ps

docker start -i IMAGE-NAME
- starts a container from an image
- i = interactive

docker kill CONTAINER-NAME
- kills running container/containers

docker commit CONTAINER-NAME-OR-ID NEW-IMAGE-NAME
- Create a new image from another container

docker diff CONTAINER
- Inspect changes to files or directories on a container's filesystem
  
docker image ls
- list images

docker container rm CONTAINER-NAME
- Remove one or more containers

docker container run -it --name hello-node node:16 bash
- name = give a name to the container
- node:16 = image parent from docker hub

docker container cp ./index.js hello-node:/usr/src/app/index.js
- Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem

docker build -t fs-hello-world .
- builds an image from Dockerfile
- t = tag name, names the image
- . refers to the dockerfile location, only . means the dockerfile is in current directory

docker run -p 3123:3000 IMAGE-NAME
- starts a container
- p = Publish a container's port(s) to the host, in this example port 3123 is host post and 3000 is container port. Basically port 3123 on the host is redirected to the containers port 3000. Can use the same port number as well like 3000:3000!

docker run -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd):/usr/src/app/" hello-front-dev
- p = hostport/containerport
- v = volume bindings
- $(pwd) = absolute path of working directory

docker compose up
- Create and start containers

docker compose up --build
- build = build images before starting containers.

docker compose down
- Stop and remove containers, networks

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down --volumes
- volumes = Remove named volumes declared in the "volumes" section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
- f = name of the configuration file

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
- d = Detached mode: Run containers in the background

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
- logs = View output from containers
- f = Follow log output

docker container run -v...
- v = volume list, bind mount a volume (file or directory) between host and container
- Changes to either file will be available in the other

docker volume ls
- list volumes

docker volume inspect VOLUME-ID
- Display detailed information on one or more volumes

docker volume rm VOLUME-ID
- remove volume

docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME bash
- exec = execute commands in a container
- above script starts bash in interactive mode
