List of used docker commands


Note: better way to build images and run containers is achieved with dockerfiles


Command line reference:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/


docker -v
- shows docker version

aliases:
docker run
docker container run

docker container run hello-world
- create and run a new container from an image
- if the specified image is not found locally, docker will try to download one from docker hub

docker container run -it ubuntu bash
- options -i -t are combined into -it
- i = interactive, t = allocate a pseudo-TTY (pseudo terminal)

docker container run --help
- shows help page for docker run

docker container run --rm ubuntu ls
- rm = automatically remove the container when it exits
- ls = terminal command to list directory contents

docker container ls -a
- lists containers
- a = show all container (default shows just running)
- alias = docker ps

docker start -i IMAGE-NAME
- starts a container from an image
- i = interactive

docker kill CONTAINER-NAME
- kills running container/containers

docker commit CONTAINER-NAME-OR-ID NEW-IMAGE-NAME
- Create a new image from another container

docker diff CONTAINER
- Inspect changes to files or directories on a container's filesystem
  
docker image ls
- list images

docker container rm CONTAINER-NAME
- Remove one or more containers

docker container run -it --name hello-node node:16 bash
- name = give a name to the container
- node:16 = image parent from docker hub

docker container cp ./index.js hello-node:/usr/src/app/index.js
- Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem

docker build -t fs-hello-world .
- builds an image from Dockerfile
- t = tag name, names the image
- . refers to the dockerfile location, only . means the dockerfile is in current directory

docker run -p 3123:3000 IMAGE-NAME
- starts a container
- p = Publish a container's port(s) to the host, in this example port 3123 is host post and 3000 is container port. Basically port 3123 on the host is redirected to the containers port 3000. Can use the same port number as well like 3000:3000!

docker compose up
- Create and start containers

docker compose down
- Stop and remove containers, networks


Ubuntu commands

Reference page:
https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/apt-get.8.html


Note: apt-get and apt are different things


apt-get update
- resynchronize the package index

apt-get -y install nano
- y = automatic yes to prompts
- install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading
- package is a package name, not a fully qualified filename

nano /usr/src/app/index.js
- opens index.js with nano

note: next command will cause installation error if following course material. Node 16 is old.
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash
- curl  is a tool to transfer data from or to a server
- s = Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  messages
- L or location = If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this  option will  make  curl  redo  the  request  on  the  new place.
- | = pipe, send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing; used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command.
- Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file

apt install -y nodejs
- apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8).
- installs the previously downloaded nodejs package.
- y = yes to prompts

node /usr/src/app/index.js
- runs index.js with node

mkdir /usr/src/app
- make directory
